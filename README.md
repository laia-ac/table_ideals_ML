# Table ideals with supervised learning

This is the accompanying code of the paper "Laia Amor√≥s, Oleksandra Gasanova and Laura Jakobsson, A machine learning approach to commutative algebra: Distinguishing table vs non-table ideals, (submitted) arXive, 2021".

In this notebooks we solve the problem of classifying table vs non-table monomial ideals. We implement 3 different machine learning algorithms: feedforward neural network, decision tree and graph neural network. The following code works for any number of variables. We have used 10 variables in this notebook.
